what is better file naming?

when I name everything like eg:
coding_01_fashion
coding_02_reviews
coding_03_abc

or:
fashion_coding01
reviews_coding02
abc_coding03

the pro in the second one is that autocompletion with tab is faster, the pro in the first one is that i can see clearly the ordering by name

in summary:
how to be consistent in naming directories and files?
