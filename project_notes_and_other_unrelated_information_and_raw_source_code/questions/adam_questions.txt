register on github or stay in gitlab?
readme file on git - should it contain information about project or about bachelor thesis (my todos and etc)
	-for now I can make todos there, but in the final version there must be DESCRIPTION
should I start writing thesis (in tex)?
my plan:
1. introduction to ML (maybe describe some of the terms?)
2. what libraries are developers using (tensorflow, etc.)
2.1 what distributions and package managers are developers prefering
2.2 use fedora and ubuntu for comparisson -not specific description, just basic information about installation in fedora vs ubuntu
-current version of ml libraries on both of the systems
3. some of the ML techniques (neural networks, genetic algorithms)
4. basic code example - tutorial codes etc (in bachelor thesis not)
4.1 make web ml quickinstall guide for fedora users
-can be in bachelor thesis, general description not specific
5. more complex code example, functional and developed by myself
	- working in web interface or just git project for users to download?
-can have GUI 
6. summary of the project

complex program expamples:
-logs from server and search for patterns of attacks
-picture recognition / face car etc /
-look for datasets / training and testing /
-ml for users' issues posted to redhat about programs | packages | etc
-ml for bug predictions for redhat

TODOs:
lookup current problems that are being solved by ML
after month meeting with adam:
- write chapter STATE OF THE ART - basically introduction and comparissons of current actual things that are being used
- 5-6pages
